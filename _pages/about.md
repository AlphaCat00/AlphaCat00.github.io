Hi there, I am Zerui Guo, a first-year PhD student at [the University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) advised by [Prof. Ming Liu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/index.html).  Previously, I obtained my master's degree from Beihang University, and my bachelor's degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

My research mainly focuses on smartNIC-assisted applications and memory fabrics.

**I am actively looking for a research internship for the next summer.**
