Hi there! I am Zerui Guo, a first-year PhD student at [the University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) advised by [Prof. Ming Liu](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mgliu/index.html).  Previously, I obtained my master's degree from Beihang University, and my bachelor's degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

My research goal is to bridge the gap between emerging hardware and networked system software. Currently, I mainly focus on smartNIC-assisted computing, such as KV stores, smartNIC models, and game streaming, as well as memory fabrics (CXL.mem).

**I am actively looking for a research internship for the next summer.**
